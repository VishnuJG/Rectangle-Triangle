# Rectangle-Triangle
Simple ML project to identify different objects...in this case rectangle and triangle
# How to run code
The lines which have the rectangle and triangle need to be replaced with the object names which you would like to work with
I have used a simple example of a triangle and rectangle, but we can use the same set of code to identify many other objects.


Also in the end I have the code to predict what value suits the SVC for the particular language. Change accordingly.


# File Description
The main .ipynb or .py file has the code for training and testing the mode.
The images folder has the set of images i have used for my practice.
